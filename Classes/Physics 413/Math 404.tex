Dealing with differential equations of the form $\dot{x}(t)=f(x(t))$
Fixed points can change, called bifurcation. Normal form of ``Saddle Node'' bifurcations is $$\dot{x}=r+x^2$$
$r$ is parameter, fixed points depend on $r$.
\\
Transcrititcal bifurcations are when there must be a critical point, but the stability of that point can change. Normal form of transcritical bifurcations is 
$$\dot{x}=rx-x^2$$
Normal form of supercritical pitchfork bifurcation: 
$$\dot{x}=rx-x^3$$
Normal form of subcritical pitchfork bifurcation:
$$\dot{x}=rx+x^3$$
