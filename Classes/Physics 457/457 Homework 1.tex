\begin{problem}
Make the following unit conversions, and show all work. 
Note that this tests how you use natural units where $c = \hbar = k_B = 1$. Thus, there is one 
fundamental dimension, which we can take to be energy and express it in GeV to various 
powers.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item 1 GeV, in joules (energy) 
    \item 1 GeV, in Kelvin (temperature) 
    \item 1 GeV, in kilograms (mass) 
    \item 1 GeV$^{-1}$, in meters (length) 
    \item 1 GeV$^{-1}$, in seconds (time) 
    \item 1 GeV$^{4}$, in kg/m$^3$ (mass density) 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item $1~GeV= 1.602\times10^{-10}~J$ 
    \item $k_B=8.617 333 262\times 10^{-5} eV/K=1
        \rightarrow
        8.617 333 262\times 10^{-14} \GeV=1K\rightarrow \coloredanswer{1\GeV=1.16045\times10^{13}K}$
    \item $E=mc^2$ so $E/c^2=m\rightarrow\coloredanswer{1\GeV=1.783 \times10^{-27} kg}$ 
    \item $E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$ so $1\GeV^{-1}=\frac{\lambda}{hc}\rightarrow \lambda=$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
    Unstable particles appear to live longer if moving, therefore can travel a longer distance after creation. Consider the following problems and calculate the flight distances. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Calculate the flight distance of a muon with 100 GeV energy. Note that the muon lifetime (in its rest frame) is $2.2 \mu s$. 
        \item Calculate the flight distance of a B$^{+}$-meson with 20 GeV energy if its lifetime is $1.6x10^{-12}$ s and its mass is 5.38 GeV. 
        \item Pions are produced in the upper atmosphere when a proton from outer space hits a proton in the atmosphere. The pions then decay into muons:
        \begin{gather*} 
            \pi^{-}\rightarrow \mu^{-}+\overline{\nu}_\mu
            \\
            \pi^{+}\rightarrow \mu^{+}+\nu_\mu
        \end{gather*}
        But the lifetime of the pion (2.6 $\times10^{-8}$ s) is much shorter than that of the muon. If the pion is produced at 800 meters above the ground, can it reach the ground if its speed is 0.998c?
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
    Antiprotons were first created at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBL) in 1955 by a proton beam hitting a proton target with the following reaction:  
    $$p+p\rightarrow 3p+\overline{p}$$  What is the minimum total energy $E$ of the proton beam to allow this reaction? Please give your answer in unit of proton mass $m_p$. (Hint: using center-of-mass energy $E_{CM}$ conservation, and assume the final particles are produced at rest.)
