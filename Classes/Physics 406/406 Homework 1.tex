\section{Homework 1}
    \begin{problem}
        Prove that the quantity $\displaystyle S=-k\sum_{r=1}^{n}p_r\ln(p_r)$ is a maximum when $p_r=\frac{1}{2}$. You may need to use the inequality: $$\ln(\oo{np_r})\leq\qty(\oo{np_r}-1)$$
        This completes the proof that the choide of equal relative probabilities for the states in a microcanonical ensemble maximizes missing information (entropy).

    \begin{problem}[Reif 2.3]
        Consider an ensemble of classical 1-D Harmonic oscillators. 
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item Let the displacement $x$ of an oscillattor as a function of time $t$ be given by $x=A\cos(\omega t+\varphi)$. Assume that the phase angle $\varphi$ is equally likely to assume any value $0<\varphi<2\pi$. The probability $w(\varphi)d\varphi$ that $\varphi$ lies in the range between $\varphi,\varphi+d\varphi$ is then simply $$w(\varphi)d\varphi=\frac{d\varphi}{2\pi}$$For any fixed time $t$, find the probability $P(x)dx$ that $x$ lies between $x+dx$ by summing $w(\varphi)d\varphi$ over all angles for which $x$ lies in this range. Express $P(x)$ in terms of $A,x$. 
            \item Consider the classical phase space for such an ensemble of oscillators, their energy being known to lie in the small range between $E,E+\delta E$. Calculate $P(x)$ by taking the ratio of that volume of phase space lying in this energy range \emph{and} in the range between $x,x+dx$ to the total volume of phase space lying in the energy range between $E,E+\delta E$. Express $P(x)$ in terms of $E,x$. By relating $E$ to the amplitude $A$, show that the result is the same as that obtained in (a)

            if its energy lies between $E$ and $E + \delta E$.
            \item Use phase space considerations to find how entropy of this system depends on $E$. (There will be an additive constant independent of $E$ which you need not determine.)

            $$\phi(E)=\frac{\pi}{6}\qty(\frac{L}{\pi\hbar})^3\qty(2mE)^{3/2}$$
            Hint: Use the energy levels 2.1.3 in Reif and treat the n as continuous variables.
            \item Calculate $\Omega(E)$
            \item A nitrogen molecule at room temperature has a typical energy of $6\times10^{-14}$ergs. Calculate $\phi(E)$ for a particle in a box of side length 10cm. Also calculate $\Omega(E)$ assuming $\delta E=10^{-24}$ergs

    \begin{problem}[Reif 2.4]
        Consider an isolated system consisting of a large number $N$ of weakly interacting localized particles of spin $\frac{1}{2}$. Each particle has a magnetic moment $\mu$ which can point either parallel or antiparallel to an applied field $H$. The energy of the system is then $E=-(n_1-n_2)\mu H$, where $n_1$ is the number of spins aligned parallel to $H$ and $n_2$ is the number of spins aligned antiparallel to $H$. 
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item Consider the energy range between $E+\delta E$ where $\delta E$ is much smaller than $E$, but $E$ is still microscopically large, so $\mu H \ll \delta E\ll E$. What is $\Omega(E)$ (the total number of states  in the energy range)?
            \item Write down an expression for $\ln(\Omega(E))$ as a function of $E$. Simplify this expression by using Stirling's formula in it's simplest form: $$\ln(n!)\approx n\ln(n)-n$$
            \item Assume that the energy $E$ is in a region where $\Omega(E)$ is appreciable~$\rightarrow$~that it is not close to the extreme possible values $\pm N\mu H$ which it can assume. In this case apply a Gaussian approximation to part (a) to obtain a simple expression for $\Omega(E)$ as a function of $E$.

        \answerline
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item Using the equation $E=-(n_1-n_2)\mu H$ and knowing that $\Omega(E)=\frac{N!}{n_1!n_2!}\delta n$
            \begin{align*}
                E&=-(n_1-n_2)\mu H=-(n_1-(N-n_1))\mu H=-(2n_1-N)\mu H
                \\

                \\
                \delta E&=|-2\delta n\mu H|\rightarrow \delta n=\frac{\delta E}{2\mu H}
                \\
                &\boxed{\Omega(E)=\frac{N!}{\qty(\oo[N]{2}-\frac{E}{2\mu H})!\qty(\oo[N]{2}+\frac{E}{2\mu H})!}\frac{\delta E}{2\mu H}}
            \end{align*}
            \item $\displaystyle\ln\Omega(E)=\ln(N!)-\ln(n_1!)-\ln(n_2!)+\ln(\frac{\delta E}{2\mu H})$
            \\ Now, using Stirling's approximation: 
            \begin{align*}
                \ln\Omega(E)&\approx N\ln(N)-N-(n_1\ln(n_1)-n_1)-(n_2\ln(n_2)-n_2)+\ln(\frac{\delta E}{2\mu H})
                \\
                &\approx N\ln(N)-\cancel{N}-n_1\ln(n_1)+\qty(\cancel{\frac{N}{2}}-\xcancel{\frac{E}{2\mu H}})-n_2\ln(n_2)+\qty(\cancel{\frac{N}{2}}+\xcancel{\frac{E}{2\mu H}})
                \\
                &\approx N\ln(N)-n_1\ln(n_1)-n_2\ln(n_2)+\ln(\frac{\delta E}{2\mu H})

    \begin{problem}[Reif 2.11]
        In a quasi-static process $A\rightarrow B$ (Add diagram) in which no heat is exchanged with the environment, the mean pressure $\overline{p}$ of a certain amount of gas is found to change with its volume $V$ according to the relation: $$\overline{p}=\alpha V^{-5/3}$$ where $\alpha$ is a constant. Find the quasi-static work done and the net heat absorbed by the system in each of the following three processes, all of which take the system from macrostate $A$ to macrostate $B$. 
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item The system is expanded from its original to its final volume, heat being added to maintain the pressure constant. The volume is then kept constant, and heat is extracted to reduce the pressure to $10^{-6}$ dynes cm$^{-2}$.
            \item The volume is increased and heat is supploed to cause the pressure to decrease linearly with the volume. 
            \item The two steps in process (a) are performed in the oppisite order.
